# AdvancedTopics-Week 9
## Major Info (TLDR)

### Goals:
My goals for this Proof of Concept were to simply make an app that could both create and recieve notifications. These goals were achieved, no question, and this POC also gave me the chance to expose myself to firebase, which was a nice added benefit.

### Problems Encountered

#### Problem 1: I, unfortunatley, had to update Android Studio from Artic Fox to Bumblebee
##### Status: I will likley come to regret this decision
When I was using Firebase to send cloud messages, it insisted that I use the most recent version of Android Studio, and by insist, I mean it would not work without me fufilling its request.

### App Completion Status
This app is completed. It can both recieve notifications from the firebase console, as well as generate a notification on a button press, that when clicked on, will take you to a new activity.
